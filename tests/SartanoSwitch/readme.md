# Recordings from the Sartano 4 channel switch remote (Model 50028)

 
The 10 files are recorded from the 8 buttons I pressed, so there should be at least one doublicate and I think one erronious recording from somthing else.


The buttons are On and Off for each of the 4 channels A, B, C and D.

It is bought in the Danish DIY shop called Harald Nyborg.
